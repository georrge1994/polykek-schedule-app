##Arhitecture and main technologies
+ Kotlin
+ Coroutines
+ Clear arhitecture (MVVM without databingins - just directly liveData)
+ Single activity app
+ Multi-module-arhitecture with auto-clearing unused modules from RAM by GC (used mechanism based on soft-references)
+ Unit tests for every each useCase, viewModel, repository + tests for room migrations and interceptors
+ Optimized UI (no xml-inlfating for recycler view items - only native views)
+ Supports landscape mode
+ kDoc for everything (used the own plugin for Android studio https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17719-advance-kotlin-documentation-generator)
+ Clear and careful coding (median size of fragments, usecases and viewmodels is 100 lines)
+ Obfuscated prod-version

##Frameworks
+ Dagger
+ Room
+ Retrofit
+ Yandex-map-kit
+ Mockito
+ Cicerone - powerfull framework for navigation. Very helpful for multi-module-arhitecture
+ Firebase messaging - used for spirit of Peter. Time to time I send users some messages or congragulations ;)
+ Crashlytic

I'm an Android developer with 5.5 years of experience. This is my pet project. You can judge me by his code. This application is not "dress app", I always use the same careful style for developing.
